\page OOLuaUnitTests Library Tests
\brief

	OOLua is a test driven library which uses two cross platform external libraries for test verification, CppUnit 1.12.1 \ref CppUnitLink "[1]" is used for state based verification and GoogleMock 1.6 \ref GMockLink "[2]" for behaviour verification. For anybody who is not fimilar with these libraries and would like to know more then I would recommed an IBM article \ref CppUnitArticle "[3]" for CppUnit whilst for GoogleMock a recorded presentation by the author \ref GMockYouTube "[4]" additionaly the library cheat sheet \ref GMockCheatSheet "[5]".
	<p>
	\section OOLuaTestFiles Directory Layout
	Library test code is situated in a directory named unit_tests in the root of a SVN branch ( including trunk \ref UnitTestTrunk "[6]" ) or the root of a released source package \ref OOLuaDownloadRef "[7]". This directory has three sub directories into which the test code is seperated.
		\li cpp_classes Classes which will be proxied in tests.
		\li bind_classes The OOLua bindings for the cpp_classes.
		\li test_classes Test suites using CppUnit and GoogleMock.
